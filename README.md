# School_District_Analysis
## Module 4

### Overview of the school district analysis: 

The purpose of this analysis is to revaluate the origianl analysis of the reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders. It seems to have been altered and there was some dishonesty throwing off the orgianl analysis. We needed to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. After we replaced the math and reading scores we repeated the school district analysis to see how these changes affected the overall analysis.

### Results: 

As you can see from the code written below, instead of the score numbers it has been replaced with "NaN" per the code.

* The district summary and school summary did not change much because of the ninth grades being taken on of the data.
* Thomas High School's performace was already pretty high and then skyrocketed relative to the other schools.
* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  - Math and reading scores by grade - The only scores that changed were the nonth grade scores we took away.
  - Scores by school spending - Budget and spending stayed the same
  - Scores by school size - School size stayed the same.
  - Scores by school type - School type stayed the same

As you can see below not much of what was asked above has changed:
