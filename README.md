# School_District_Analysis
## Module 4

### Overview of the school district analysis: 

The purpose of this analysis is to revaluate the origianl analysis of the reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders. It seems to have been altered and there was some dishonesty throwing off the orgianl analysis. We needed to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. After we replaced the math and reading scores we repeated the school district analysis to see how these changes affected the overall analysis.

### Results:
